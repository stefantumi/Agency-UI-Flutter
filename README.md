# Real Estate Manager

A platform for managing Real Estate Agencies.
CRM for agents and a portal for customers

## Heads Up
When Creating a Property, they do not appear in the property list for the agency,
you'll be able to find them in the Properties tab 

## Status: *`Proof Of Concept`*
Most features are broken. Don't expect to be informed about successful or failed actions

### Features: *`That Work`*
CRUD is basically the only thing that works, It might not seem like they work, but they DO! 

### Instructions (How to use):
1. Agency 
   1. Create Property - press the "+" icon to the right of "Properties". 
      1. you won't be notified on success or failuer.
      2. all fields need to be filled
      3. Properties list won't update, you'll need to return to list of agencies and open agency again
   2. Update Property - press the pencil to the right of the property instance
      1. Fill All fields to be able to update, Again you won't be informed if action was successful or not
   3. Delete Property - HOLD DOWN THE PENCIL
      1. You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to delete the property or not.


### Personal side note
This is likely about 10% of what I had imagined I would be able to do.  
Data is not converted to classes everywhere so beware. 
This is due to time constraints and to reach the goal of having a CRUD operations that work whithin timeframe.
